IFOX Assembler used in MVS 3.8
==============================

This is the assembler source code for the.... assembler.  

Assembler XF, also called IFOX assembler, is a mostly compatible upgrade of Assembler F that includes the new System/370 architecture instructions. This version provides a common assembler for OS/VS, DOS/VS and VM systems. Other changes include relaxing restrictions on expressions and macro processing. Assembler XF requires a minimum partition/region size of 64 KB (virtual). 

Its main feature was to combine the second pass of conditional assembly (“Pass B”) and the first pass of ordi- nary assembly (“Pass 1”). The primary benefits of Assembler XF were improved performance, and some language enhancements made at the same time. (And, the assembler manuals were completely and elegantly rewritten!)
