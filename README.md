FX (aka IFOX) Assembler used in OS/VS, DOS, VM
==============================================

This is the assembler source code for the.... assembler.  

Assembler XF, also called IFOX assembler, is a mostly compatible upgrade of Assembler F that includes the new System/370 architecture instructions. This version provides a common assembler for OS/VS, DOS/VS and VM systems. Other changes include relaxing restrictions on expressions and macro processing. Assembler XF requires a minimum partition/region size of 64 KB. Yes, that's asking a lot, but in the meantime there are now mainframes with up to 1MB of memory, so 64KB for an assembler is not a totally crazy amount. 

Its main feature is to combine the second pass of conditional assembly (“Pass B”) and the first pass of ordi- nary assembly (“Pass 1”). The primary benefits of Assembler XF were improved performance, and some language enhancements made at the same time. The assembler manuals were completely and elegantly rewritten!
